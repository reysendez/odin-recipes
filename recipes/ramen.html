        <p>The goal here was to achieve a tonkotsu-like broth without using any meat. Tomato paste, dried shiitake mushrooms, kombu, and a little bit of butter help to get you that rich umami-like effect.</p>
    
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>¼ cup plus 2 Tbsp. vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp. black or white sesame seeds</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp. gochugaru (coarse Korean red pepper powder) or 1½ tsp. crushed red pepper flakes 
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>4 scallions</li>
            <li>1 2" piece ginger, peeled, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp. tomato paste</li>
            <li>8 dried shiitake mushrooms</li>
            <li>1 4x3" piece dried kombu</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp. unsalted butter, cut into pieces</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp. low-sodium soy sauce</li>
            <li>4 baby bok choy (about 12oz. total)</li>
            <li>4 5-oz. packages fresh ramen noodles</li>
            <li>Jammy eggs, toasted nori sheets, and/or cilantro (for serving; optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook garlic and ¼ cup oil in a medium pot over medium heat, stirring often, until garlic is beginning to turn golden, about 3 minutes. Stir in sesame seeds and cook, stirring occasionally, until garlic is golden brown and crisp, about 1 minute. Transfer mixture to a small bowl and stir in gochugaru; season with salt. Set garlic oil aside. Wipe out pot and set aside.</li>
            <li>Trim dark green parts from scallions and thinly slice; set aside for serving. Coarsely chop white and pale green parts. Heat remaining 2 Tbsp oil in reserved pot over medium-high. Cook chopped scallions and ginger, stirring often, until scallions are charred in spots, about 4 minutes. Add tomato paste and cook, stirring occasionally, until it begins to stick to the bottom of pot and darkens slightly, about 2 minutes. Add mushrooms and kombu, then stir in 5 cups cold water. Bring to a boil, then remove from heat and let sit until mushrooms soften, about 10 minutes. Remove and discard kombu.</li>
            <li>Using a slotted spoon, transfer solids to a blender. Add a ladleful or 2 of broth to blender and purée until smooth. Stir purée back into broth in pot and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Add butter a piece at a time, whisking to combine after each addition before adding more. Stir in soy sauce; season with salt. Reduce heat to low and keep warm until ready to serve.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add bok choy and cook until bright green and tender, about 2 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer bok choy to a plate. Return water to a boil and cook noodles according to package directions. Drain and divide among bowls.</li>
            <li>To serve, ladle broth over noodles, then top with bok choy and reserved garlic oil. Top with eggs, nori, and cilantro if desired.</li>
        </ol>
